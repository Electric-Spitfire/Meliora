"""	It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; 
who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; 
who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, 
and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, 
so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

"""	Stern men with empires in their brains.

"""	We do not admire the man of timid peace. We admire the man who embodies victorious effort; 
the man who never wrongs his neighbor, who is prompt to help a friend, but who has those virile qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual life. 
It is hard to fail, but it is worse to never have tried to succeed.

"""	they shall endeavor, not to shirk difficulties, but to overcome them; not to seek ease, but to know how to rest triumph from toil and risk

"""	The blessing of freedom requires the ballast of duty, and informed judgment is the indispensable handmaiden of duty.

"""	Their loftiest praise has been already spoken. For in magnifying the city I have magnified them, and men like them whose virtues made her glorious.
--- Pericles, Funeral Oration 404 B.C.E.""",

"""	For even those who come short in other ways may justly plead the valor with which they have fought for their country; 
they have blotted out the evil with the good, and have benefited the state more by their public services than they have injured her by their private actions. 
None of these men were enervated by wealth or hesitated to resign the pleasures of life; 
none of them put off the evil day in the hope, natural to poverty, that a man, though poor, may one day become rich.
--- Pericles, Funeral Oration 404 B.C.E""",

""" But, deeming that the punishment of their enemies was sweeter than any of these things, 
and that they could fall in no nobler cause, they determined at the hazard of their lives to be honorably avenged, and to leave the rest. 
They resigned to hope their unknown chance of happiness; but in the face of death they resolved to rely upon themselves alone. 
And when the moment came they were minded to resist and suffer, rather than to fly and save their lives; they ran away from the word of dishonor, 
but on the battlefield their feet stood fast, and in an instant, at the height of their fortune, they passed away from the scene, 
not of their fear, but of their glory.
--- Pericles, Funeral Oration 404 B.C.E""",

"""I would have you day by day fix your eyes upon the greatness of Athens, until you become filled with the love of her; 
and when you are impressed by the spectacle of her glory, reflect that this empire has been acquired by men who knew their duty and had the courage to do it, 
who in the hour of conflict had the fear of dishonor always present to them, and who would not allow their virtues to be lost to their country, 
but freely gave their lives to her as the fairest offering which they could present at her feast.

""""Congratulate yourselves that you have been happy during the greater part of your days; 
remember that your life of sorrow will not last long, and be comforted by the glory of those who are gone. 
For the love of honor alone is ever young, and not riches, as some say, but honor is the delight of men when they are old and useless.

"""The most valuable real estate in the world is the graveyard.
There lie millions of half-written books, ideas never launched, and talents never developed. Most people die with everything still inside of them.
The way to live is to create. Die empty.
Get every idea out of your head and into reality.
